It is a Rust implementation of ["Ray Tracing: The Next Week" by Peter Shirley](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html)

i used an improved version of bvh, which you can find in the [aabb-rewrite branch](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io/tree/aabb-rewrite).

it is not a good implementation, just a simple rewrite in Rust, and needs some optimization of processing the images
